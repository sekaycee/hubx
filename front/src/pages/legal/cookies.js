      'Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.  Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the Cookie.  Owners of a website can use Cookies for a variety of reasons that can include enabling their websites to work (or work more efficiently), providing personalized content and advertising, and creating website analytics.',
      'Cookies are typically classified as either “session cookies” which are automatically deleted when you close your browser, or “persistent cookies” which will usually remain on your device until you delete them or they expire.  Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, HubX) are called "first party cookies".  Only HubX can access the first party cookies we set. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and social sharing). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your device both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits other websites that have partnered with them.',
      'In addition to cookies, we may use other similar technologies like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs") or local storage.  Web beacons are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Services or opened an e-mail that we have sent them.  This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Services to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Services from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns.  Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s) in order to enable certain functionality in our Services.  Local storage may be used to improve your experience with our Services, for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences, and speeding up site functionality.'
